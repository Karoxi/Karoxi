## Hi there, I'm Karoline 👋

I’m a trained application developer (IHK Fachinformatikerin für Anwendungsentwicklung) with hands-on experience in Python and Webdevelopment.

---

## 🎯 What drives me

- I'm endlessly curious. I need to learn new things to stay engaged.  
- I like systems, but I don’t fit well into rigid ones.  
- I thrive with structure I create myself – especially in **remote** or flexible environments.  
- I use tools like [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev) to learn in an ADHD-friendly way, and it works far better for me than traditional schooling ever did.

## 👋 "Hello, world."

I have `hello world` tattooed on my left forearm.

It's more than the first line of code i ever wrote — it's a part of who I am.  
To me, it stands for curiosity, openness, and the courage to begin.

## 🛠 What you’ll find here

Not just another calculator app. Instead, you'll find tools I built to be useful – to me, and maybe to you too.

For example:
- 📝 `NoteTime`: A personal memory system to store key learnings – and remids you when you forget what you've already figured out.

---

## 🌱 Looking forward

 I’m looking for a parttime or working student position where I can contribute code, learn from others, and grow with real-world challenges.

**Tech I’m using:** Python, SQL, SQLite, Git, VSCode, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Windows, WSL

Let’s work together if you’re looking for a motivated junior who’s still learning, but curious, reliable, and not afraid to figure things out.
